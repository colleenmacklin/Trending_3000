A game of conversational sabotage made by robots
</div>
        <p>
        	<h3>THE GOAL </h3>of the game is to subtly Trend Topics during the course of normal conversation.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        	<h3>TO START:</h3> Send your friends this link: <a href = "http://trendingtopics.fun">http://trendingtopics.fun</a>
        	 <p>See that word or phrase? That's your Topic. Keep it secret! That is, until it's time to <b>Trend</b>!</p>
         </p>
     	 <p>
      	 If your topic is PIZZATOWN, you might say:
          <blockquote>"Won't you take me to... <h3>PIZZATOWN</h3>?"</blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
            <h3>BUT THERE'S A CATCH!</h3> While you try to sneak PIZZATOWN into conversation, others are listening for you to say strange things, too. If they catch on to your attempt to trend PIZZATOWN, they can call you out by saying <blockquote>"You're trending <h3>PIZZATOWN</h3>!"</blockquote> (They have to get the term correct, or mostly correct.)
      </p>
   

         <p>
        	<h3>WINNING:</h3> Who's counting? But if you're the competitive type, feel free to attach a point, a wager, or shots to each successfully Trended Topic - and each time you catch a friend trying to Trend. End the game whenever you want - or never!
    </p>
      <p>
      <h3>TIPS: </h3>
      Have a topic that's hard to sneak into conversation? No problem, pick another! 
      Don't feel like talking? Don't worry, you can still win! Simply listen carefully for odd words or turns of phrase - you can also win by catching others trying to trend!
